In the end
----
- The essence of learning is `input and output`.   
- When I first learned about the `Feynman Technique`, I deeply recognized and was always influenced by it, so I created `XDocs` for recording. I have used static blog building tools such as `Hexo`,`VuePress`, and `Wrodpress` to building a blog. There was a version of `VuePress`called `XDocs`, but most of them did not accumulate or persist.
- After learning about `Vue3` & `Vite`, I came into contact with the excellent building tool `VitePress` and decided to use it as the final solution.

> To some extent, I would like to use the `XDocs` as a secondary repository for storing knowledgeÔºåand share it with all friends.
> If it's helpful to you üåπÔºåYou could click on **Star** in the upper right corner would be better for me. Thank you ^_^ÔºÅ
